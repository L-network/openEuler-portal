openEuler is a new member of the Linux ecosystem, which aims to create an open, diversify, architecture-inclusive software ecosystem that caters to the needs of the community.

For those of you who are not yet familiar with openEuler, we'll hold a live talk show, openEuler TechDay, to give a general overview, including basics, updates, and the evolution of the ecosystem. During this event, we will be joined by technology experts, community advocates, and SIG members, who will share ideas, answer questions, and build relationships.

Weâ€™d like to extend a warm invitation to open source enthusiasts, developers, thought leaders, and anyone who has interest in openEuler, to join us at openEuler TechDay.

Our second episode will go online this month, and will help you get started with openEuler. We look forward to meeting you online during the event.
